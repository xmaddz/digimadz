  <h1>Madz's ART 222 Portfolio!</h1>
<h2> Project 1: </h2>
  <p> This project was all about logos, more specifically making a logo for the University of Southern Maine's Planetarium. I actually had a lot of fun making these and I believe they turned out well despite having no experience with Adobe Illustrator. I focused mostly on the university's colors and also attempted to use a similar color to the machine that the planetarium uses. I studied what logos the university normally uses in order to fit the theme. The shape of the star projector was a bit diffucult to mimic, but I do enjoy the organic silouhette it created. I would absolutely would use Adobe Illustrator again! </p>

<h2> Project 2: </h2>
  <p> Project 2 was all about using photoshop, focusing on creating 2 pieces depicting a Dystopian world, Utopia, or Usotopia world. I knew originally I wanted to create something based on animals, but I struggled to pinpoint exactly what. I chose to do a little play on the treatment of animals and what it would be like if roles were reversed. One depicts humans inside a zoo enclosure, while the animals sit and watch. The space of the enclosure is meant to feel small, as that is what a majority of zoo enclosures are like; small and not suitable for a healthy life of the animal. The second picture is a little less unserious and depicts a tiger eating a bowl of human stew. Despite my difficulties learning about Photoshop and figuring out what to depict, I still had fun creating these pieces.</p>

<h2> Project 3: </h2>
  <p> Project 3 definitely threw me for a loop, as I wasn't sure of what I wanted to create. I had originally been thinking of creating a music video of sorts, but was told to expand my mind a little more. I decided to do a video poem in which I describe my experience with having BPD. I ended up having a lot of fun figuring out how to layer each video I found to create a video collage that feels as odd as the words that are written. I decided to add an instrumental of a broken piano to add to that queasy feeling the video is trying to portray. </p>

<h2> Project 4: </h2>
  <p> In project 4, we were asked to create a 3D model of an item that is important to us using blender. I decided to use a small bunny dumpling plush I had been gifted for christmas last year. Because not much time had been available between the 3rd project and this project, I had an incredibily hard time getting it to shape the ears how I wanted to. I wanted to incorporate the indents the ears of the bunny have, but was unable to manipulate the shape how I wanted, leaving it, in my opinion, messy. However, if more time had been given, I could've probably figureed it out. I experiemented with trying to give the bunny's tail more fuzz by finding the hair section of the modifiers. I attempted to also give fur to the body of the bunny itself, but it was not successful. Overall, if given more time to explore blender, I might've been a bit more successful. </p>
